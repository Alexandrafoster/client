          <p class="mb-4" style="color: white;">
            As a travel writer, I am frequently invited on press trips with a fixed schedule; but, after that is completed, I frequently extend my stay to explore the place at my leisure. When I'm not working, though, I try to spend at least two weeks in a different city (sometimes, for at least a month). After that, I'd compose travel guides and itineraries based on my personal experiences as well as the information I'd gathered. MY GOAL: With my third global passport, I want to visit every country on the planet â€“ but I'm not in any hurry to do it. I'm just grateful that I'm already living my goal and that I can assist others in doing so as well!
